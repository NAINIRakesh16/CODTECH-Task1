key points:

1. Entity Declaration: Defines the SPI Master entity with ports for clock, reset, enable, clock polarity, clock phase, MISO, SCLK, SS_N, MOSI, busy, TX, and RX.

2. Generic Parameter: Specifies the data length in bits (default 16).

3. Signal Declarations: Defines internal signals for FSM state, receive/transmit mode, clock toggle counter, last bit indicator, receive/transmit buffers, and internal SS_N/SCLK signals.

4. Finite State Machine (FSM): Implements two states - init (idle) and execute (communication).

5. SPI Master Protocol:
    - Initiates communication on enable.
    - Sets clock polarity and phase.
    - Transmits and receives data.
    - Toggles SCLK and SS_N signals.

6. Clock Toggle Counter: Tracks clock cycles.

7. Receive/Transmit Mode: Switches between transmit and receive modes.

8. Internal Registers: Holds data to be transmitted (txBuffer) and received data (rxBuffer).

9. Output Signals: Drives SS_N, SCLK, MOSI, and busy signals.

10. Process Statements:
    - Resets FSM and signals on reset.
    - Initiates communication on enable.
    - Implements SPI master protocol.
